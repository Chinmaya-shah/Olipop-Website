# **App Name**: Olipop Parallax

## Core Features:

- Parallax Hero: Create a full-screen hero section with a scroll-controlled WebP image sequence that swaps based on drink variant.
- Variant Navigation: Implement right-side vertical navigation to switch between drink variants (name, description, color, image sequence) with a fade-in/fade-out text transition and loading indicator.
- Dynamic Theming: Allow users to toggle between dark and light mode, applying the theme color to CTAs and accents.
- Smooth Scroll Navigation: Implement a sticky top navigation bar with smooth scrolling links to different sections (Product, Ingredients, Nutrition, etc.) and active section indication.
- Customizable Content: Enable users to change drink names, descriptions, theme colors, and WebP image sequences for each drink variant via a simple CMS.
- Loading Experience: Implement a loading overlay with a progress bar for initial sequence load and a loading indicator when switching variants.
- Image Generation: Generate marketing visuals with similar style to a square CTA product image of the Andy Grape Soda using generative AI tool. (i.e. a bold monochrome purple background, smooth studio gradient, clean and minimal; A grape Soda can placed centered and upright, with crisp studio lighting and soft shadow; realistic, glossy grapes piled across the width).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Near-black background (#121212) for a dark, cinematic look, complementing the requested dark theme.
- Background color: Charcoal gray (#333333), a desaturated version of the primary color to offer depth without distraction.
- Accent color: Bright white (#FFFFFF) used for text and key highlights to create stark contrast against the dark background.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean, and readable look across all sections.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use minimal, monochrome social icons in the footer to maintain a clean and consistent visual style.
- Full-screen hero section with overlay text block on the left and variant navigation on the right. Maintain a visually clean center area.
- Smooth parallax scrolling effect tied to the WebP image sequence for a cinematic and responsive user experience.
